  abstract = {Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) are becoming an
indispensable module that enables hands-free interaction between
human users and smartphones. Unfortunately, recent research
revealed a side channel that allows zero-permission motion
sensors to eavesdrop on the VUI voices from the co-located
smartphone loudspeaker. Nonetheless, these threats are limited
to leaking a small set of digits and hot words. In this paper,
we propose StealthyIMU, a new threat that uses motion sensors
to steal permission-protected private information from the VUIs.
We develop a set of efficient models to detect and extract private
information, taking advantage of the deterministic structures in
the VUI responses. Our experiments show that StealthyIMU can
steal private information from 23 types of frequently-used voice
commands to acquire contacts, search history, calendar, home
address, and even GPS trace with high accuracy. We further
propose effective mechanisms to defend against StealthyIMU
without noticeably impacting the user experience.},
