abstract = {Network Functions (NFs) perform on-path processing of network traffic. ISPs are deploying
NF Virtualization (NFV) with software NFs run on commodity servers. ISPs aim to ensure
that NF chains, directed acyclic graphs of NFs, do not violate Service Level Objectives
(SLOs) promised by the ISP to its customers. To meet SLOs, NFV systems sometimes leverage
on-path hardware (such as programmable switches and smart NICs) to accelerate NF execution.Lemur
places and executes NF chains across heterogeneous hardware while meeting SLOs. Lemur's
novel placement algorithm yields an SLO-satisfying NF placement while weighing many
constraints: hardware memory and processing stages, server cores, link capacity, NF
profiles, and NF chain interactions. Lemur's metacompiler automatically generates
code and rules (in P4, Python, eBPF, C++, and OpenFlow) to stitch cross-platform NF
chain execution while also optimizing resource usage. Our experiments show that Lemur
is alone among competing strategies in meeting SLOs for canonical NF chains while
maximizing marginal throughput (the traffic rate in excess of the service-level objective).},
