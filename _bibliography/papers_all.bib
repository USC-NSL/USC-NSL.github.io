abstract = {Advances in deep learning (DL) have prompted the development of cloud-hosted DL-based media applications that process video and audio streams in real-time. Such applications must satisfy throughput and latency objectives and adapt to novel types of dynamics, while incurring minimal cost. Scrooge, a system that provides media applications as a service, achieves these objectives by packing computations efficiently into GPU-equipped cloud VMs, using an optimization formulation to find the lowest cost VM allocations that meet the performance objectives, and rapidly reacting to variations in input complexity (e.g., changes in participants in a video). Experiments show that Scrooge can save serving cost by 16-32% (which translate to tens of thousands of dollars per year) relative to the state-of-the-art while achieving latency objectives for over 98% under dynamic workloads.},

abstract = {While most networks have long lifetimes, temporary network infrastructure is often useful for special events, pop-up retail,
or disaster response. An instant IoT network is one that is rapidly constructed, used for a few days, then dismantled. We consider the
synthesis of instant IoT networks in urban settings. This synthesis problem must satisfy complex and competing constraints: sensor
coverage, line-of-sight visibility, and network connectivity. The central challenge in our synthesis problem is quickly scaling to large
regions while producing cost-effective solutions. We explore two qualitatively different representations of the synthesis problems using
satisfiability modulo convex optimization (SMC), and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The former is more expressive, for our
problem, than the latter, but is less well-suited for solving optimization problems like ours. We show how to express our network
synthesis in these frameworks. To scale to problem sizes beyond what these frameworks are capable of, we develop a hierarchical
synthesis technique that independently synthesizes networks in sub-regions of the deployment area, then combines these. We find
that, while MILP outperforms SMC in some settings for smaller problem sizes, the fact that SMC’s expressivity matches our problem
ensures that it uniformly generates better quality solutions at larger problem sizes.},

abstract = {While prior work has explored many proposed datacenter designs, only two designs,
Clos-based and expander-based, are generally considered practical because they can
scale using commodity switching chips. Prior work has used two different metrics,
bisection bandwidth and throughput, for evaluating these topologies at scale. Little
is known, theoretically or practically, how these metrics relate to each other. Exploiting
characteristics of these topologies, we prove an upper bound on their throughput,
then show that this upper bound better estimates worst-case throughput than all previously
proposed throughput estimators and scales better than most of them. Using this upper
bound, we show that for expander-based topologies, unlike Clos, beyond a certain size
of the network, no topology can have full throughput, even if it has full bisection
bandwidth; in fact, even relatively small expander-based topologies fail to achieve
full throughput. We conclude by showing that using throughput to evaluate datacenter
performance instead of bisection bandwidth can alter conclusions in prior work about
datacenter cost, manageability, and reliability.},

the overhead and errors due to ambiguous sentences, and to improve the generality

take to produce a fully-general and useful system for easing the natural-language

the ambiguity inherent in such text, it is not surprising that protocol implementations 
have long exhibited bugs. In this paper, we apply natural language processing (NLP) 
to effect semi-automated generation of protocol implementations from specification 
text. Our system, Sage, can uncover ambiguous or under-specified sentences in specifications; 
once these are clarified by the author of the protocol specification, Sage can generate 
protocol code automatically.Using Sage, we discover 5 instances of ambiguity and 6 
instances of under-specification in the ICMP RFC; after fixing these, Sage is able 
to automatically generate code that interoperates perfectly with Linux implementations. 
We show that Sage generalizes to sections of BFD, IGMP, and NTP and identify additional 
conceptual components that Sage needs to support to generalize to complete, complex 
protocols like BGP and TCP.},

abstract = {Network Functions (NFs) perform on-path processing of network traffic. ISPs are deploying NF Virtualization (NFV) with software NFs run on commodity servers. ISPs aim to ensure that NF chains, directed acyclic graphs of NFs, do not violate Service Level Objectives (SLOs) promised by the ISP to its customers. To meet SLOs, NFV systems sometimes leverage on-path hardware (such as programmable switches and smart NICs) to accelerate NF execution.Lemur places and executes NF chains across heterogeneous hardware while meeting SLOs. Lemur's novel placement algorithm yields an SLO-satisfying NF placement while weighing many constraints: hardware memory and processing stages, server cores, link capacity, NF profiles, and NF chain interactions. Lemur's metacompiler automatically generates code and rules (in P4, Python, eBPF, C++, and OpenFlow) to stitch cross-platform NF chain execution while also optimizing resource usage. Our experiments show that Lemur is alone among competing strategies in meeting SLOs for canonical NF chains while maximizing marginal throughput (the traffic rate in excess of the service-level objective).},

abstract = {The performance and availability of cloud and content providers often depends on the wide area networks (WANs) they use to interconnect their datacenters. WAN routers, which connect to each other using trunks (bundles of links), are sometimes built using an internal Clos topology connecting merchant-silicon switches. As such, these routers are susceptible to internal link and switch failures, resulting in reduced capacity and low availability. Based on the observation that today's WAN routers use relatively simple trunk wiring and routing techniques, we explore the design of novel wiring and more sophisticated routing techniques to increase failure resilience. Specifically, we describe techniques to 1) optimize trunk wiring to increase effective internal router capacity so as to be resilient to internal failures, 2) compute the effective capacity under different failure patterns, and 3) use these to compute compact routing tables under different failure patterns, since switches have limited routing table sizes. Our evaluations show that our approach can mask failures of up to 75% of switches in some cases without exceeding routing table limits, whereas competing techniques can sometimes lose half of a WAN router's capacity with a single failure.

We propose Tetrium, a system for multi-resource allocation in geo-distributed 
clusters, that jointly considers both compute and network resources for task placement and job scheduling. Tetrium significantly reduces job response time, while incorporating several other performance goals with simple control knobs. Our EC2 deployment and trace-driven simulations suggest that Tetrium improves the average job response time by up to 78% compared to existing data-locality-based solutions, and up to 55% compared to Iridium, the recently proposed geo-distributed analytics system.},

These 3D sensors are used for improving vehicular safety in autonomous driving, but have fundamentally limited visibility due to occlusions, sensing range, and extreme weather and lighting conditions. To improve visibility and performance, we explore a capability called Augmented Vehicular Reality (AVR). AVR broadens the vehicle's visual horizon by enabling it to wirelessly share visual information with other nearby vehicles. We show that AVR is feasible using off-the-shelf wireless technologies, and it can qualitatively change the decisions made by autonomous vehicle path planning algorithms. Our AVR prototype achieves positioning accuracies that are within a few percentages of car lengths and lane widths, and it is optimized to process frames at 30fps.},

abstract = {Like today's autonomous vehicle prototypes, vehicles in the future will have rich sensors to map and identify objects in the environment. For example, many autonomous vehicle prototypes today come with line-of-sight depth perception sensors like 3D cameras. These cameras are used for improving vehicular safety in autonomous driving, but have fundamentally limited visibility due to occlusions, sensing range, and extreme weather and lighting conditions. To improve visibility and performance, not just for autonomous vehicles but for other Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), we explore a capability called Augmented Vehicular Reality (AVR). AVR broadens the vehicle's visual horizon by enabling it to share visual information with other nearby vehicles, but requires careful techniques to align coordinate frames of reference, and to detect dynamic objects. Preliminary evaluations hint at the feasibility of AVR and also highlight research challenges in achieving AVR's potential to improve autonomous vehicles and ADAS.},

Our approach is able to calculate source line level energy consumption information. It does this by combining hardware-based power measurements with program analysis and statistical modeling.

abstract = {Mobile data usage is on a tremendous rise, due not only to increasing number of users but also to an increase in the number of applications that transfer data over the network. Moreover, applications for sharing, sensing, and collaboration have become more popular, causing signiﬁcant amounts of data to be generated on devices. Managing this data –syncing it to the cloud, or with other users or devices– is a crucial and often 
challenging part of writing mobile apps and services. In spite of plenty of good advice and best practices from OS vendors and network operators, storing and transferring mobile data is fraught with issues. On the one hand, an app developer needs to worry about the semantics of data storage and synchronization, while on the other, about the end-user experience, which maybe impacted by poor and intermittent network connectivity. To address the needs of the app developers and the end-users, we have built Izzy: a platform to rapidly develop and deploy data-centric mobile apps. Izzy provides well-deﬁned and easy to use semantics for accessing local storage and for synchronizing data with a remote, scalable, global store. Izzy also provides global store access to the cloud-resident part of the applications (if any) through a similar server API. Last but not least, Izzy is designed to be frugal: it conserves mobile device resources by applying delay-tolerance and data reduction techniques (message coalescing and compression) across applications on a mobile device. In this paper we present the design of Izzy and our early experiences with using it.},

As researchers and developers turn their attention to understanding the ecosystem and its different apps, instrumentation of mobile apps is a much needed emerging capability. In this paper, we explore a selective instrumentation capability that allows users to express instrumentation specifications at a high level of abstraction; these specifications are then used to automatically insert instrumentation into binaries. The challenge in our work is to develop expressive abstractions for instrumentation that can also be implemented efficiently. Designed using requirements derived from recent research that has used instrumented apps, our selective instrumentation framework, SIF, contains abstractions that allow users to compactly express precisely which parts of the app need to be instrumented. It also contains a novel path inspection capability, and provides users feedback on the approximate overhead of the instrumentation specification. Using experiments on our SIF implementation for Android, we show that SIF can be used to compactly (in 20-30 lines of code in most cases) specify instrumentation tasks previously reported in the literature. SIF's overhead is under 2% in most cases, and its instrumentation overhead feedback is within 15% in many cases. As such, we expect that SIF can accelerate studies of the mobile app ecosystem.},

Unlike previous work on wireless sensing, crowd-sensing poses several novel requirements: support for humans-in-the-loop to trigger sensing actions or review results, the need for incentives, as well as privacy and security. In this paper, we design and implement Medusa, a novel programming framework for crowd sensing that satisfies these requirements. Medusa provides high-level abstractions for specifying the steps required to complete a crowd-sensing task, and employs a distributed runtime system that coordinates the execution of these tasks between smartphones and a cluster on the cloud. We have implemented ten crowd-sensing tasks on a prototype of Medusa. We find that Medusa task descriptions are two orders of magnitude smaller than standalone systems required to implement those crowd-sensing tasks, and the runtime has low overhead and is robust to dynamics and resource attacks.},

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ''Snooze'', an energy management technique for 802.11n which uses two novel and inter-dependent mechanisms: client ''micro-sleeps'' and ''antenna configuration management''. In ''Snooze'', the AP monitors traffic on the WLAN and directs client sleep times and durations as well as antenna configurations, without significantly affecting throughput or delay. ''Snooze'' achieves 30~ 85% energy-savings over CAM across workloads ranging from VoIP and video streaming to file downloads and chats.},

 CAPS is designed based on the insight that users exhibit consistency

 position. To this end, CAPS uses a cell-ID sequence match- 
 ing technique to estimate current position based on the history of 
 cell-ID and GPS position sequences that match the current cell-ID 
 sequence. We have implemented CAPS on Android-based smartphones 
 and have extensively evaluated it at different locations, and

 that CAPS can save more than 90% of the energy spent by the positioning 
 system compared to the case where GPS is always used, 
 while providing reasonably accurate position information with errors 
 less than 20% of the celltower-based scheme.},

Social swarming, in which users armed with smartphones 
are directed by a central director to report on events in the

we focus on the following problem: how does the director optimize 
the selection of reporters to deliver credible corroborating 
information about an event? We first propose a model, based 
on common intuitions of believability, about the credibility of 
information. We then cast the problem as a discrete optimization 
problem, and introduce optimal centralized solutions and an 
approximate solution amenable to decentralized implementation 
whose performance is about 20% off on average from the optimal 
while being 3 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. 
More interesting, a time-averaged version of the problem is 
amenable to a novel stochastic utility optimization formulation, 
and can be solved optimally, while in some cases yielding 
decentralized solutions.},

 acoustic localization) will need to transport large volumes of data 
 concurrently from several sensors. These applications are also 
 loss-intolerant. A key requirement for such applications, then, 
 is a protocol that reliably transport sensor data from many sources 
 to one or more sinks without incurring congestion collapse. 
 In this paper, we discuss RCRT, a rate-controlled reliable transport 
 protocol suitable for constrained sensor nodes. 
 RCRT uses end-to-end explicit loss recovery, but places all the 
 congestion detection and rate adaptation functionality in the sinks. 
 This has two important advantages: efficiency and flexibility. 
 Because sinks make rate allocation decisions, they are able to 
 achieve greater efficiency since they have a more comprehensive 
 view of network behavior. For the same reason, it is possible to 
 alter the rate allocation decisions (for example, from one that 
 ensures that all nodes get the same rate, to one that ensures that 
 nodes get rates in proportion to their demands), without modifying 
 sensor code at all. We evaluate RCRT extensively on a 40-node wireless 
 sensor network testbed and show that RCRT achieves 1.7 times the rate 
 achieved by IFRC and 1.4 times that of WRCP, two recently proposed 
 interference-aware distributed rate-control protocols. 
 We also present results from a 3-month-long 19-node real world 
 deployment of RCRT in an imaging application and show that RCRT works 
 well in real long-term deployments.},

abstract = {Many emerging smartphone applications require position information to 
 provide location-based or context-aware services. In these 
 applications, GPS is often preferred over its alternatives such as 
 GSM/WiFi based positioning systems because it is known to be more 
 accurate. However, GPS is extremely power hungry. Hence a common 
 approach is to periodically duty-cycle GPS. However, GPS duty-cycling 
 trades-off positioning accuracy for lower energy. A key requirement 
 for such applications, then, is a positioning system that provides 
 accurate position information while spending minimal energy. 
 
 In this paper, we present RAPS, rate-adaptive positioning system for 
 smartphone applications. It is based on the observation that GPS is 
 generally less accurate in urban areas, so it suffices to turn on GPS 
 only as often as necessary to achieve this accuracy. RAPS uses a 
 collection of techniques to cleverly determine when to turn on GPS. 
 It uses the location-time history of the user to estimate user 
 velocity and adaptively turn on GPS only if the estimated uncertainty 
 in position exceeds the accuracy threshold. It also efficiently 
 estimates user movement using a duty-cycled accelerometer, and 
 utilizes Bluetooth communication to reduce position uncertainty among 
 neighboring devices. Finally, it employs celltower-RSS blacklisting to 
 detect GPS unavailability (e.g., indoors) and avoid turning on GPS in 
 these cases. We evaluate RAPS through real-world experiments using a 
 prototype implementation on a modern smartphone and show that it can 
 increase phone lifetimes by more than a factor of 3.8 over an approach 
 where GPS is always on.},

 This capability requires the transfer of large volumes of data from

 Smartphones have multiple wireless interfaces~--~3G/EDGE and 
 WiFi~--~for data transfer, but there is considerable variability in 
 the availability and achievable data transfer rate for these networks. 
 Moreover, the energy costs for transmitting a given amount of data on 
 these wireless interfaces can differ by an order of magnitude. 
 On the other hand, many of these applications are often naturally 
 delay-tolerant, so that it is possible to delay data transfers until a 
 lower-energy WiFi connection becomes available. 
 In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing an 
 optimal online algorithm for this emphenergy-delay tradeoff using the 
 Lyapunov optimization framework. 
 Our algorithm, called salsa, can automatically adapt to channel 
 conditions and requires only local information to decide whether and 
 when to defer a transmission. 
 We evaluate salsa using real-world traces as well as 
 experiments using a prototype implementation on a modern smartphone. 
 Our results show that salsa can be tuned to achieve a broad spectrum 
 of energy-delay tradeoffs, is closer to an empirically-determined 
 optimal than any of the alternatives we compare it to, and, can save 
 10-40% of battery capacity for some workloads.},

 We find that qualitative similarities exist among users that 
 facilitate the task of learning user behavior. For instance, 
 the relative application popularity for can be modeled using 
 an exponential distribution, with different distribution 
 parameters for different users. We demonstrate the value of 
 adapting to user behavior in the context of a mechanism to

 While we were among the earliest promoters of this approach,

 unmanageable systems and explore an alternative. 
 The Tenet architecture is motivated by the observation that future 
 large-scale sensor network deployments will be tiered, 
 consisting of motes in the lower tier and masters, 
 relatively unconstrained 32-bit platform nodes, in the upper tier. 
 Tenet constrains multi-node fusion to the master tier while allowing 
 motes to process locally-generated sensor data. 
 This simplifies application development and allows mote-tier software to be reused. 
 Applications running on masters task motes 
 by composing task descriptions from a novel tasklet library. 
 Our Tenet implementation also contains a robust and scalable networking 
 subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably delivering responses. 
 We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion 
 application exhibits performance comparable to a mote-native 
 implementation while being considerably more compact. 
 We also present two real-world deployments of Tenet system; 
 structural vibration monitoring application at Vincent Thomas Bridge and 
 imaging-based habitat monitoring application at James Reserve;

 a simple question: How often are such faults observed in real 
 deployments & quest; We focus on three types of transient faults, 
 caused by faulty sensor readings that appear abnormal. To understand 
 the prevalence of such faults, we first explore and characterize four 
 qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods. Rule-based 
 methods leverage domain knowledge to develop heuristic rules for 
 detecting and identifying faults. Estimation methods predict ¡°normal¡± 
 sensor behavior by leveraging sensor correlations, flagging anomalous 
 sensor readings as faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods start 
 with an a priori model for sensor readings. A sensor measurement is 
 compared against its predicted value computed using time series 
 forecasting to determine if it is faulty. Learning-based methods infer 
 a model for the ¡°normal¡± sensor readings using training data, and then 
 statistically detect and identify classes of faults. 
 
 We find that these four classes of methods sit at different points on 
 the accuracy/robustness spectrum. Rule-based methods can be highly 
 accurate, but their accuracy depends critically on the choice of 
 parameters. Learning methods can be cumbersome to train, but can 
 accurately detect and classify faults. Estimation methods are accurate, 
 but cannot classify faults. Time-series-analysis-based methods are more 
 effective for detecting short duration faults than long duration ones, 
 and incur more false positives than the other methods. We apply these 
 techniques to four real-world sensor datasets and find that the 
 prevalence of faults as well as their type varies with datasets. 
 All four methods are qualitatively consistent in identifying sensor 
 faults, lending credence to our observations. Our work is a first step 
 towards automated online fault detection and classification.},

 an increasing need for re-usable, dynamically taskable 
 software systems that support multiple concurrent 
 applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of 
 energy management in such systems, taking Tenet as a case 
 study. Our work considers energy management under three new 
 constraints: dynamic multi-hop routing and tasking, multiple 
 concurrent applications, and reliable end-to-end data 
 delivery. We present AEM, an energy management system that 
 satisfies these constraints. AEM statically analyzes and 
 infers the traffic profile for the application and 
 accordingly tunes the duty-cycling protocol to provide the 
 best trade-off in latency and data delivery performance. 
 Furthermore, unlike other duty-cycling protocols with 
 pre-computed or fixed transmission and reception time slots, 
 AEM uses elastic schedules that allows it to adapt to 
 dynamics while enabling bounded latency of event detection. 
 Our experiments show that AEM achieves 1-3% duty-cycles, 
 while allowing concurrent applications to transmit 100% of 
 the sensor data in a multi-hop 40-node network testbed.},

 those strategies do not scale beyond a small number of robots. In 
 this paper, we design and implement a partition strategy where 
 pursuers capture evaders by decomposing the game into multiple 
 multi-pursuer single-evader games. Our algorithm terminates, 
 has bounded capture time, is robust, and is scalable in the number 
 of robots. In our implementation, a sensor network provides 
 sensing-at-a-distance, as well as a communication backbone that 
 enables tighter coordination between pursuers. Our experiments 
 in a challenging office environment suggest that this approach is 
 near-optimal, at least for the configurations we have evaluated.

 studies of several pieces of the architecture. In comparison 
 with prior bridge monitoring systems and sensor network 
 prototypes, our contributions are three-fold. First, we 
 have designed a novel event detection mechanism that triggers 
 data collection in response to an oncoming train. Next, Bri- 
 Mon employs a simple yet effective multi-channel data transfer 
 mechanism to transfer the collected data onto a sink located 
 on the moving train. Third, the BriMon architecture is 
 designed with careful consideration of the interaction between 
 the multiple requisite functionalities such as time synchronization, 
 event detection, routing, and data transfer. Based 
 on a prototype implementation, this paper also presents several 
 measurement studies to show that our design choices are

 because application developers have little visibility

 this paper presents HERMES, a lightweight framework 
 and prototype tool that provides fine-grained visibility and 
 control of a sensor node's software at run-time. HERMES's 
 architecture is based on the notion of interposition, which 
 enables it to provide these properties in a minimally intrusive 
 manner, without requiring any modification to software 
 applications being observed and controlled. HERMES provides 
 a general, extensible, and easy-to-use framework for 
 specifying which software components to observe and control 
 as well as when and how this observation and control 
 is done. We have implemented and tested a fully functional 
 prototype of HERMES for the SOS sensor operating system. 
 Our performance evaluation, using real sensor nodes 
 as well as cycle-accurate simulation, shows that HERMES 
 successfully achieves its objective of providing fine-grained 
 and dynamic visibility and control without incurring significant 
 resource overheads. We demonstrate the utility and 
 flexibility of HERMES by using our prototype to design, implement, 
 and evaluate three case-studies: debugging and 
 testing deployed sensor network applications, performing 
 transparent software updates in sensor nodes, and implementing 
 network traffic shaping and resource policing.},

abstract = {Emerging high-rate applications (imaging, structural monitoring, 
 acoustic localization) will need to transport large volumes of data 
 concurrently from several sensors. 
 These applications are also loss-intolerant. 
 A key requirement for such applications, then, is a protocol that 
 reliably transport sensor data from many sources to one or more sinks 
 without incurring congestion collapse. 
 In this paper, we discuss RCRT, a rate-controlled reliable transport 
 protocol suitable for constrained sensor nodes. 
 RCRT uses end-to-end explicit loss recovery, but places all the 
 congestion detection and rate adaptation functionality in the sinks. 
 This has two important advantages: efficiency and flexibility. 
 Because sinks make rate allocation decisions, they are able to achieve 
 greater efficiency since they have a more comprehensive view of 
 network behavior. 
 For the same reason, it is possible to alter the rate allocation 
 decisions (for example, from one that ensures that all nodes get the 
 same rate, to one that ensures that nodes get rates in proportion to 
 their demands), without modifying sensor code at all. 
 We evaluate RCRT extensively on a 40-node wireless sensor network 
 testbed and show that RCRT achieves more than twice the rate achieved by 
 a recently proposed interference-aware distributed rate-control 
 protocol, IFRC.},

 architecture is motivated by the observation that future largescale 
 sensor network deployments will be tiered, consisting 
 of motes in the lower tier and masters, relatively unconstrained 
 32-bit platform nodes, in the upper tier. Masters 
 provide increased network capacity. Tenet constrains multinode 
 fusion to the master tier while allowing motes to process 
 locally-generated sensor data. This simples application 
 development and allows mote-tier software to be reused. 
 Applications running on masters task motes by composing 
 task descriptions from a novel tasklet library. Our Tenet implementation 
 also contains a robust and scalable networking 
 subsystem for disseminating tasks and reliably delivering 
 responses.We show that a Tenet pursuit-evasion application

 fair rate control (IFRC) detects incipient congestion at a 
 node by monitoring the average queue length, communicates congestion 
 state to exactly the set of potential interferers using a novel 
 low-overhead congestion sharing mechanism, and converges to a 
 fair and efficient rate using an AIMD control law. We evaluate 
 IFRC extensively on a 40-node wireless sensor network testbed. 
 IFRC achieves a fair and efficient rate allocation that is within 20- 
 40% of the optimal fair rate allocation on some network topologies. 
 Its rate adaptation mechanism is highly effective: we did not observe 
 a single instance of queue overflow in our many experiments. 
 Finally, IFRC can be extended easily to support situations where 
 only a subset of the nodes transmit, where the network has multiple 
 base stations, or where nodes are assigned different transmission

 enable dense monitoring of large physical structures and promise 
 enormous ease and flexibility of deployment of instrumentation, as

 However, programming sensing applications on a network of wireless 
 sensors remains a difficult and time-consuming endeavor. This is due 
 in part to the complexity of such systems. Their limited battery 
 resources, and the highly variable performance of wireless 
 communication in different environments represent significant 
 constraints that, if each application developer were forced to deal 
 with, can significantly increase the time to develop robust 
 applications. 
 We have been developing a networked software system called Tenet that 
 simplifies the programming of wireless sensor actuator systems. A 
 Tenet system is a two-tier networked system consisting of two classes 
 of nodes: a higher-tier with several nodes containing 32-bit 
 processors and IEEE 802.11b radios, and a lower-tier comprising 
 battery-operated sensor nodes with less-capable processors, low-power 
 radios. Our Tenet software runs application code on the higher-tier 
 nodes, and provides a generic interface for tasking sensors and 
 actuators. This separation of functionality simplifies application 
 development greatly, since developers can reuse networking and sensor 
 data extraction code, thereby reducing application development time. 
 We will report on the development of and experiences with 
 structural data acquisition application for a long-span suspension 
 bridge using Tenet. We will report on our experiences in deploying 
 a two-tier network of wireless sensors on the bridge. We will report

 it has become possible to envision smart structures containing 
 millions of sensors embedded in concrete for autonomously 
 detecting and locating incipient damage. 
 Where are we today in our march towards this vision of 
 autonomous structural health monitoring (SHM) using 
 networked embedded sensing? In this paper, we summarize some of 
 the systems we have developed towards this vision. 
 Wisden is a wireless sensor network that allows continuous 
 monitoring of structures and NetSHM is a programmable system 
 that allows civil engineers to implement and deploy 
 SHM techniques without having to understand the intricacies 
 of wireless sensor networking. We highlight our experiences 
 in developing these systems, and discuss the implications of 
 our experiences on the achievability of the overall vision.},

 the performance of a multi-hop wireless data acquisition 
 system (called Wisden) for structural health monitoring

 engineers. Our experiments indicate that, with the latest 
 sensor network hardware, Wisden can reliably deliver 
 time-synchronized tri-axial structural vibration data reliably 
 across multiple hops with low latencies for sampling 
 rates up to 200Hz. This performance was achieved by iteratively 
 refining the system design using a series of test deployments. 
 Our experiences suggested the need for careful 
 onset detection in order to preserve the fidelity of the structures

 missions involve increasingly large number of satellites and surface

 use static routing cannot scale to large numbers of satellites

 intelligently use them for routing. Furthermore, most of the science 
 missions will be geared towards collecting data using various 
 sensors. Adoption of a data-centric communication mechanism can enable 
 in-network aggregation and processing which help make data forwarding 
 more efficient. In this paper, we briefly describe ASCoT, a routing 
 system for science missions of tomorrow, which a) leverages the 
 predictability of satellite trajectories to effect position-based 
 routing in the space backbone, and b) departs from traditional 
 address-centric communication and uses a data-centric architecture to 
 enable energy efficient and low latency operation in proximity

abstract = {Unpredictable and heterogeneous links in a wireless sensor network 
 require techniques to avoid low delivery rate and high delivery cost. 
 Three commonly used techniques to help discover high quality paths 
 include (1) link-layer retransmission, (2) blacklisting bad links, and 
 (3) end-to-end routing metrics. Using simulation and testbed 
 experiments, we present the first systematic exploration of the 
 tradeoffs of combinations of these approaches, quantifying the effects 
 of each of these three techniques. We identify several key results: 
 One is that per-hop retransmissions (ARQ) is a necessary addition to 
 any other mechanism if reliable data delivery is a goal. Additional 
 interactions between the services are more subtle. First, in a 
 multi-hop network, either blacklisting or reliability metrics like ETX 
 can provide consistent high-reliability paths when added to ARQ. 
 Second, at higher deployment densities, blacklisting has a lower 
 routing overhead than ETX. But at lower densities, blacklisting 
 becomes less stable as the network partitions. These results are 
 consistent across both simulation and testbed experiments. We 
 conclude that ETX with retransmissions is the best choice in general, 
 but that blacklisting may be worth considering at higher densities, 
 either with or without ETX.},

abstract = {In many sensor networks, data or events are named by attributes. 
 Many of these attributes have scalar values, 
 so one natural way to query events of interest is 
 to use a emphmulti-dimensional range query. 
 An example %of such a range query is: 
 ``List all events whose temperature lies between 50$^circ$ 
 and 60$^circ$, and whose light levels lie between 10 and 15.'' 
 Such queries are useful for correlating events occurring 
 within the network. 
 
 In this paper, we describe the design of a distributed index 
 that scalably supports multi-dimensional range queries. 
 Our emphdistributed index for multi-dimensional data (or DIM) 
 uses a novel geographic embedding of a classical index data structure, 
 and is built upon the GPSR geographic routing algorithm. 
 Our analysis reveals that, under reasonable assumptions 
 about query distributions, DIMs scale quite well with 
 network size (both insertion and query costs scale as 
 $O(sqrtN)$). 
 In detailed simulations, we show that in practice, the 
 insertion and query costs of other alternatives 
 are sometimes an order of magnitude more than the costs of DIMs, 
 even for moderately sized network. 
 Finally, experiments on a small scale testbed validate 
 the feasibility of DIMs.},

 has led to an 
 interest in quantitatively understanding both the causes (e.g. 
 multihoming) as well as the effects (e.g. impact on router lookup 
 implementations) of such routing table growth. In this paper, we 
 describe a new model called ARAM that defines the structure of routing 
 tables of any given size. Unlike simpler empirical models that work 
 backwards from effects (e.g. current prefix length distributions), 
 ARAM approximately models the causes of table growth (allocation by 
 registries, assignment by ISPs, multihoming and load balancing). We 
 show that ARAM models with high fidelity three abstract measures 
 (prefix distribution, prefix depth, and number of nodes in the tree) 
 of the shape of the prefix tree --- as validated against 20 snapshots 
 of backbone routing tables from 1997 to the present. We then use ARAM 
 for evaluating the scalability of IP lookup schemes, and studying 
 the effects of multihoming and load balancing on their scaling behavior. 
 Our results indicate that algorithmic solutions based on multibit 
 tries will provide more 
 prefixes per chip than TCAMs (as table sizes scale toward a million) 
 unless TCAMs can be engineered to use 8 transistors per cell. 
 By contrast, many of today's SRAM based TCAMs use 12-16 transistors per cell.},

abstract = {Distributed hash table (DHT) systems are an important class 
 of peer-to-peer routing infrastructures. They enable 
 scalable wide-area storage and retrieval of information, 
 and will support the rapid development of a wide variety of 
 Internet-scale applications ranging from naming systems and 
 file systems to application-layer multicast. DHT systems 
 essentially build an overlay network, but a path on the 
 overlay between any two nodes can be significantly 
 different from the unicast path between those two nodes on 
 the underlying network. As such, the lookup latency in 
 these systems can be quite high and can adversely impact 
 the performance of applications built on top of such 
 systems. 
 
 In this paper, we discuss a random sampling technique that 
 incrementally improves lookup latency in DHT systems. Our 
 sampling can be implemented using information gleaned from 
 lookups traversing the overlay network. For this reason, we 
 call our approach em lookup-parasitic random sampling (LPRS). 
 LPRS is fast, incurs little network overhead, and requires 
 relatively few modifications to existing DHT systems. 
 
 For idealized versions of DHT systems like Chord, Tapestry 
 and Pastry, we analytically prove that LPRS can result in 
 lookup latencies proportional to the diameter of the 
 network, provided the underlying physical topology has a 
 power-law latency expansion. We then validate this analysis 
 by implementing LPRS in the Chord simulator. Our 
 simulations reveal that LPRS-Chord exhibits a qualitatively 
 better latency scaling behavior relative to unmodified 
 Chord. 
 
 Finally, we provide evidence which suggests that the 
 Internet router-level topology resembles power-law latency 
 expansion. This finding implies that LPRS has significant 
 practical applicability as a general latency reduction 
 technique for many DHT systems. This finding is also of 
 independent interest since it might inform the design of 
 latency-sensitive topology models for the Internet.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks involve very large numbers of small, 
 low-power, wireless devices. Given their unattended nature, and their 
 potential applications in harsh environments, we need a monitoring 
 infrastructure that indicates system failures and resource depletion. 
 In this paper, we briefly describe an architecture for sensor network 
 monitoring, then focus on one aspect of this architecture: continuously 
 computing aggregates (sum, average, count) of network properties 
 (loss rates, energy-levels etc., packet counts). 
 Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a novel tree construction 
 algorithm that enables energy-efficient computation of some classes 
 of aggregates. Second, we show through actual implementation 
 and experiments that wireless 
 communication artifacts in even relatively benign environments can 
 significantly impact the computation of these aggregate properties. 
 In some cases, without careful attention to detail, the relative error 
 in the computed aggregates can be as much as 50%. However, by carefully 
 discarding lossy and asymmetric links, we can improve accuracy 
 by an order of magnitude.},

address = {Berkeley, CA},
abstract = {There exist many successful examples of 
 on-line reputation (or rating) systems, such as on-line 
 markets and e-tailer ratings. 
 However, for peer-to-peer applications, an explicit ratings 
 subsystem has often been ignored in system design because of the 
 implicit assumption of trust and altruism among P2P users. 
 This assumption might be true (or might not matter) when a P2P network 
 is still in its infancy and is relatively small in size. 
 But the assumption might break down with increase in the 
 size and diversity of the P2P network. 
 In this paper, we discuss issues in the 
 design of rating schemes for P2P systems. 
 In keeping with the design philosophy of many of these system, 
 we consider the design of distributed rating systems. 
 As a case study, we illustrate two different approaches to 
 a distributed rating system aimed at tackling the free-rider 
 problem in P2P networks. 
 A key challenge in designing such rating schemes is to make 
 them collusion-proof: we discuss our efforts in this direction.},

year  = {2003},
date = {2003-01-01},
journal = {Ad-hoc Networks Journal},
abstract = {A wireless sensor network for detecting large-scale 
 phenomena (such as a contaminant flow or a seismic disturbance) 
 may be called upon to provide a description of the boundary 
 of the phenomenon (either a contour or some bounding box). 
 In such cases, it may be necessary for each node to locally 
 determine whether it lies at (or near) the edge of the 
 phenomenon. In this paper, we show that such localized edge 
 detection techniques are non-trivial to design in an 
 arbitrarily deployed sensor network. 
 We define the notion of an edge and develop performance 
 metrics for evaluating localized edge detection algorithms. We 
 propose three different approaches for localized edge detection and 
 present one example scheme for each. In all our approaches, each 
 sensor gathers information from its local neighborhood and 
 determines whether or not it is an edge sensor. We evaluate 
 the performance of each of the example schemes and compare them with 
 respect to the developed metrics.},

abstract = {Sensor networks pose new challenges in the collection and distribution 
 of data. Recently, much attention has been focused on standing queries 
 that use in-network aggregation of time series data to return data 
 statistics in a communication-efficient manner. In this work, rather 
 than consider searches over time series data, we consider searches 
 over semantically rich high-level events, and present the design, 
 analysis, and numerical simulations of a spatially distributed index 
 that provides for efficient index construction and range searches. The 
 scheme provides for a more balanced sharing of communication load 
 over index nodes by using 
 the governing property that the wider the spatial extent known to an 
 index node, the more constrained is the value range covered by that 
 node.},
