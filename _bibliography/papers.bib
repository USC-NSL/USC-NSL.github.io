abstract = {Advances in deep learning (DL) have prompted the development of cloud-hosted DL-based media applications that process video and audio streams in real-time. Such applications must satisfy throughput and latency objectives and adapt to novel types of dynamics, while incurring minimal cost. Scrooge, a system that provides media applications as a service, achieves these objectives by packing computations efficiently into GPU-equipped cloud VMs, using an optimization formulation to find the lowest cost VM allocations that meet the performance objectives, and rapidly reacting to variations in input complexity (e.g., changes in participants in a video). Experiments show that Scrooge can save serving cost by 16-32\% (which translate to tens of thousands of dollars per year) relative to the state-of-the-art while achieving latency objectives for over 98\% under dynamic workloads.},

abstract = {While most networks have long lifetimes, temporary network infrastructure is often useful for special events, pop-up retail,
or disaster response. An instant IoT network is one that is rapidly constructed, used for a few days, then dismantled. We consider the
synthesis of instant IoT networks in urban settings. This synthesis problem must satisfy complex and competing constraints: sensor
coverage, line-of-sight visibility, and network connectivity. The central challenge in our synthesis problem is quickly scaling to large
regions while producing cost-effective solutions. We explore two qualitatively different representations of the synthesis problems using
satisfiability modulo convex optimization (SMC), and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The former is more expressive, for our
problem, than the latter, but is less well-suited for solving optimization problems like ours. We show how to express our network
synthesis in these frameworks. To scale to problem sizes beyond what these frameworks are capable of, we develop a hierarchical
synthesis technique that independently synthesizes networks in sub-regions of the deployment area, then combines these. We find
that, while MILP outperforms SMC in some settings for smaller problem sizes, the fact that SMC’s expressivity matches our problem
ensures that it uniformly generates better quality solutions at larger problem sizes.},

abstract = {While prior work has explored many proposed datacenter designs, only two designs,
Clos-based and expander-based, are generally considered practical because they can
scale using commodity switching chips. Prior work has used two different metrics,
bisection bandwidth and throughput, for evaluating these topologies at scale. Little
is known, theoretically or practically, how these metrics relate to each other. Exploiting
characteristics of these topologies, we prove an upper bound on their throughput,
then show that this upper bound better estimates worst-case throughput than all previously
proposed throughput estimators and scales better than most of them. Using this upper
bound, we show that for expander-based topologies, unlike Clos, beyond a certain size
of the network, no topology can have full throughput, even if it has full bisection
bandwidth; in fact, even relatively small expander-based topologies fail to achieve
full throughput. We conclude by showing that using throughput to evaluate datacenter
performance instead of bisection bandwidth can alter conclusions in prior work about
datacenter cost, manageability, and reliability.},

take to produce a fully-general and useful system for easing the natural-language

the ambiguity inherent in such text, it is not surprising that protocol implementations 
have long exhibited bugs. In this paper, we apply natural language processing (NLP) 
to effect semi-automated generation of protocol implementations from specification 
text. Our system, Sage, can uncover ambiguous or under-specified sentences in specifications; 
once these are clarified by the author of the protocol specification, Sage can generate 
protocol code automatically.Using Sage, we discover 5 instances of ambiguity and 6 
instances of under-specification in the ICMP RFC; after fixing these, Sage is able 
to automatically generate code that interoperates perfectly with Linux implementations. 
We show that Sage generalizes to sections of BFD, IGMP, and NTP and identify additional 
conceptual components that Sage needs to support to generalize to complete, complex 
protocols like BGP and TCP.},

abstract = {Network Functions (NFs) perform on-path processing of network traffic. ISPs are deploying NF Virtualization (NFV) with software NFs run on commodity servers. ISPs aim to ensure that NF chains, directed acyclic graphs of NFs, do not violate Service Level Objectives (SLOs) promised by the ISP to its customers. To meet SLOs, NFV systems sometimes leverage on-path hardware (such as programmable switches and smart NICs) to accelerate NF execution.Lemur places and executes NF chains across heterogeneous hardware while meeting SLOs. Lemur's novel placement algorithm yields an SLO-satisfying NF placement while weighing many constraints: hardware memory and processing stages, server cores, link capacity, NF profiles, and NF chain interactions. Lemur's metacompiler automatically generates code and rules (in P4, Python, eBPF, C++, and OpenFlow) to stitch cross-platform NF chain execution while also optimizing resource usage. Our experiments show that Lemur is alone among competing strategies in meeting SLOs for canonical NF chains while maximizing marginal throughput (the traffic rate in excess of the service-level objective).},

abstract = {The performance and availability of cloud and content providers often depends on the wide area networks (WANs) they use to interconnect their datacenters. WAN routers, which connect to each other using trunks (bundles of links), are sometimes built using an internal Clos topology connecting merchant-silicon switches. As such, these routers are susceptible to internal link and switch failures, resulting in reduced capacity and low availability. Based on the observation that today's WAN routers use relatively simple trunk wiring and routing techniques, we explore the design of novel wiring and more sophisticated routing techniques to increase failure resilience. Specifically, we describe techniques to 1) optimize trunk wiring to increase effective internal router capacity so as to be resilient to internal failures, 2) compute the effective capacity under different failure patterns, and 3) use these to compute compact routing tables under different failure patterns, since switches have limited routing table sizes. Our evaluations show that our approach can mask failures of up to 75\% of switches in some cases without exceeding routing table limits, whereas competing techniques can sometimes lose half of a WAN router's capacity with a single failure.

We propose Tetrium, a system for multi-resource allocation in geo-distributed 
clusters, that jointly considers both compute and network resources for task placement and job scheduling. Tetrium significantly reduces job response time, while incorporating several other performance goals with simple control knobs. Our EC2 deployment and trace-driven simulations suggest that Tetrium improves the average job response time by up to 78\% compared to existing data-locality-based solutions, and up to 55\% compared to Iridium, the recently proposed geo-distributed analytics system.},

These 3D sensors are used for improving vehicular safety in autonomous driving, but have fundamentally limited visibility due to occlusions, sensing range, and extreme weather and lighting conditions. To improve visibility and performance, we explore a capability called Augmented Vehicular Reality (AVR). AVR broadens the vehicle's visual horizon by enabling it to wirelessly share visual information with other nearby vehicles. We show that AVR is feasible using off-the-shelf wireless technologies, and it can qualitatively change the decisions made by autonomous vehicle path planning algorithms. Our AVR prototype achieves positioning accuracies that are within a few percentages of car lengths and lane widths, and it is optimized to process frames at 30fps.},

abstract = {Like today's autonomous vehicle prototypes, vehicles in the future will have rich sensors to map and identify objects in the environment. For example, many autonomous vehicle prototypes today come with line-of-sight depth perception sensors like 3D cameras. These cameras are used for improving vehicular safety in autonomous driving, but have fundamentally limited visibility due to occlusions, sensing range, and extreme weather and lighting conditions. To improve visibility and performance, not just for autonomous vehicles but for other Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), we explore a capability called Augmented Vehicular Reality (AVR). AVR broadens the vehicle's visual horizon by enabling it to share visual information with other nearby vehicles, but requires careful techniques to align coordinate frames of reference, and to detect dynamic objects. Preliminary evaluations hint at the feasibility of AVR and also highlight research challenges in achieving AVR's potential to improve autonomous vehicles and ADAS.},

abstract = {Mobile data usage is on a tremendous rise, due not only to increasing number of users but also to an increase in the number of applications that transfer data over the network. Moreover, applications for sharing, sensing, and collaboration have become more popular, causing signiﬁcant amounts of data to be generated on devices. Managing this data –syncing it to the cloud, or with other users or devices– is a crucial and often 
challenging part of writing mobile apps and services. In spite of plenty of good advice and best practices from OS vendors and network operators, storing and transferring mobile data is fraught with issues. On the one hand, an app developer needs to worry about the semantics of data storage and synchronization, while on the other, about the end-user experience, which maybe impacted by poor and intermittent network connectivity. To address the needs of the app developers and the end-users, we have built Izzy: a platform to rapidly develop and deploy data-centric mobile apps. Izzy provides well-deﬁned and easy to use semantics for accessing local storage and for synchronizing data with a remote, scalable, global store. Izzy also provides global store access to the cloud-resident part of the applications (if any) through a similar server API. Last but not least, Izzy is designed to be frugal: it conserves mobile device resources by applying delay-tolerance and data reduction techniques (message coalescing and compression) across applications on a mobile device. In this paper we present the design of Izzy and our early experiences with using it.},

abstract = {Mobile app ecosystems have experienced tremendous growth in the last five years. As researchers and developers turn their attention to understanding the ecosystem and its different apps, instrumentation of mobile apps is a much needed emerging capability. In this paper, we explore a selective instrumentation capability that allows users to express instrumentation specifications at a high level of abstraction; these specifications are then used to automatically insert instrumentation into binaries. The challenge in our work is to develop expressive abstractions for instrumentation that can also be implemented efficiently. Designed using requirements derived from recent research that has used instrumented apps, our selective instrumentation framework, SIF, contains abstractions that allow users to compactly express precisely which parts of the app need to be instrumented. It also contains a novel path inspection capability, and provides users feedback on the approximate overhead of the instrumentation specification. Using experiments on our SIF implementation for Android, we show that SIF can be used to compactly (in 20-30 lines of code in most cases) specify instrumentation tasks previously reported in the literature. SIF's overhead is under 2\% in most cases, and its instrumentation overhead feedback is within 15\% in many cases. As such, we expect that SIF can accelerate studies of the mobile app ecosystem.},

We answer fundamental questions such as which segments of the application are most efﬁcient to be hosted on the low power processor, and how to select an appropriate low power processor.

Unlike previous work on wireless sensing, crowd-sensing poses several novel requirements: support for humans-in-the-loop to trigger sensing actions or review results, the need for incentives, as well as privacy and security. In this paper, we design and implement Medusa, a novel programming framework for crowd sensing that satisfies these requirements. Medusa provides high-level abstractions for specifying the steps required to complete a crowd-sensing task, and employs a distributed runtime system that coordinates the execution of these tasks between smartphones and a cluster on the cloud. We have implemented ten crowd-sensing tasks on a prototype of Medusa. We find that Medusa task descriptions are two orders of magnitude smaller than standalone systems required to implement those crowd-sensing tasks, and the runtime has low overhead and is robust to dynamics and resource attacks.},

Recent work has shown that 802.11n interfaces are power-hungry, so energy management is an important challenge. 802.11n implementations have additional power states relative to earlier generations of 802.11 technology, so energy management challenges for 802.11n are qualitatively different compared to that faced by prior work. 
 
In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of ''Snooze'', an energy management technique for 802.11n which uses two novel and inter-dependent mechanisms: client ''micro-sleeps'' and ''antenna configuration management''. In ''Snooze'', the AP monitors traffic on the WLAN and directs client sleep times and durations as well as antenna configurations, without significantly affecting throughput or delay. ''Snooze'' achieves 30~ 85\% energy-savings over CAM across workloads ranging from VoIP and video streaming to file downloads and chats.},

abstract = {Wireless sensing and actuation have been explored in many contexts, but the 
automotive setting has received relatively little attention. Automobiles have 
tens of onboard sensors and expose several hundred engine parameters which can 
be tuned (a form of actuation). The optimal tuning for a vehicle can depend 
upon terrain, traffic, and road conditions, but the ability to tune a vehicle 
has only been available to mechanics and enthusiasts. In this paper, we 
describe the design and implementation of CarMA (Car Mobile Assistant), a 
system that provides high-level abstractions for sensing automobile parameters 
and tuning them. Using these abstractions, developers can easily write 
smartphone ``apps'' to achieve fuel efficiency, responsiveness, or safety goals. 
Users of CarMA can tune their vehicles at the granularity of individual trips, 
a capability we call personalized tuning. We demonstrate through a variety of 
applications written on top of CarMA that personalized tuning can result in 
over 10\% gains in fuel efficiency. We achieve this through route-specific or 
driver-specific customizations. Furthermore, CarMA is capable of improving user 
satisfaction by increasing responsiveness when necessary, and promoting 
vehicular safety by appropriately limiting the range of performance available 
to novice or unsafe drivers.},

Our method is based on a novel combination of static analysis with symbolic execution

are likely vulnerable, and the latter emulates adversarial actions

We apply it to four diverse protocols, including TCP, the 802.11 MAC, ECN, and SCTP,

for these protocols. We also .nd a previously unreported attack for SCTP. 
This attack is a variant of a TCP attack but must be mounted differently in SCTP

 factors such as the network and device capabilities. To 
 this end we develop Odessa, a novel, lightweight, runtime that automatically

 for mobile interactive perception applications. Our evaluation 
 shows that the incremental greedy strategy of Odessa converges to 
 an operating point that is close to an ideal offline partitioning. It 
 provides more than a 3x improvement in application performance 
 over partitioning suggested by domain experts. Odessa works well 
 across a variety of execution environments, and is agile to changes

 more energy-hungry GPS. 
 In this paper, we present CAPS, a Cell-ID Aided Positioning 
 System. CAPS leverages near-continuous mobility and the position 
 history of a user to achieve significantly better accuracy than 
 the celltower-based approach, while keeping energy overhead low. 
 CAPS is designed based on the insight that users exhibit consistency 
 in routes traveled, and that cell-ID transition points that the 
 user experiences can, on a frequently traveled route, uniquely identify 
 position. To this end, CAPS uses a cell-ID sequence match- 
 ing technique to estimate current position based on the history of 
 cell-ID and GPS position sequences that match the current cell-ID 
 sequence. We have implemented CAPS on Android-based smartphones 
 and have extensively evaluated it at different locations, and 
 for different platforms and carriers. Our evaluation results show 
 that CAPS can save more than 90\% of the energy spent by the positioning 
 system compared to the case where GPS is always used, 
 while providing reasonably accurate position information with errors 
 less than 20\% of the celltower-based scheme.},

become possible to conceive of entirely new classes of applications. 
Social swarming, in which users armed with smartphones 
are directed by a central director to report on events in the 
physical world, has several real-world applications. In this paper, 
we focus on the following problem: how does the director optimize 
the selection of reporters to deliver credible corroborating 
information about an event? We first propose a model, based 
on common intuitions of believability, about the credibility of 
information. We then cast the problem as a discrete optimization 
problem, and introduce optimal centralized solutions and an 
approximate solution amenable to decentralized implementation 
whose performance is about 20\% off on average from the optimal 
while being 3 orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. 
More interesting, a time-averaged version of the problem is 
amenable to a novel stochastic utility optimization formulation, 
and can be solved optimally, while in some cases yielding 
decentralized solutions.},

abstract = {Wireless sensing and actuation have been explored in many contexts, but the 
automotive setting has received relatively little attention. Automobiles have 
tens of onboard sensors and expose several hundred engine parameters which can 
be tuned (a form of actuation). The optimal tuning for a vehicle can depend 
upon terrain, traffic, and road conditions, but the ability to tune a vehicle 
has only been available to mechanics and enthusiasts. In this paper, we 
describe the design and implementation of CarMA (Car Mobile Assistant), a 
system that provides high-level abstractions for sensing automobile parameters 
and tuning them. Using these abstractions, developers can easily write 
smartphone ``apps'' to achieve fuel efficiency, responsiveness, or safety goals. 
Users of CarMA can tune their vehicles at the granularity of individual trips, 
a capability we call personalized tuning. We demonstrate through a variety of 
applications written on top of CarMA that personalized tuning can result in 
over 10\% gains in fuel efficiency. We achieve this through route-specific or 
driver-specific customizations. Furthermore, CarMA is capable of improving user 
satisfaction by increasing responsiveness when necessary, and promoting 
vehicular safety by appropriately limiting the range of performance available 
to novice or unsafe drivers.},

 (Gollakota and Katabi 2008) can achieve in multi-user random 
 access systems. ZigZag is a recently proposed 802.11 receiver 
 design that allows successful reception of packets despite 
 collision. Thus, the maximum achievable throughput of a wireless 
 LAN can be significantly improved by using ZigZag decoding. 
 We analyze the throughput bounds in four different idealized 
 multi-access system models for the case when ZigZag decoding 
 is used. We also provide results for the Aloha and CSMA models 
 where exact closed form solutions are infeasible to calculate. 
 Our analysis and simulation results show that ZigZag decoding 
 can significantly improve the maximum throughput of the random 
 access system.},
