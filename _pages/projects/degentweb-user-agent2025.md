# DeGenTWeb: Detect Generated Text on the Web

You might be accessing this page because you received requests which
included the link to this page in the `user-agent`.
The requests you received are benign and are generated at a low rate.
They were generated as part of an academic study to
measure how much text content on the Web is AI-generated.

More detailed information about the project is given below.
**If you would like us to stop making these requests to your site,
please send us an email at *sichangh AT usc DOT edu* and
we will exclude your site from our crawls.**

## What is the goal of this project?

AI-generated content has become increasingly prevalent on
the Web. Consequently, the Web, once honored as
the largest public collection of human knowledge for human consumption and
machine learning, may lose its relevance as its content quality degrades.
How much of the Web users face is AI-generated?
How can we characterize such generated content?
Our project collects public webpages and
applies state-of-the-art classifiers to detect AI-generated text, with
the goal of understanding the above questions.
